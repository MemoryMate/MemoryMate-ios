# MemoryMate-ios

What is the app?
A native iOS application that helps caregivers better ensure their loved ones are on track with their daily responsibilities through push notification reminders. Particularly targeted for those who suffer from dementia, Alzheimer's, or other memory-related illnesses.
MemoryMates removes the technical barrier of the typical reminder app by outsourcing the setup to a loved one or caregivers.
